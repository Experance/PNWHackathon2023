# PNWHackathon2023
Chrome extension built by Andrew &amp; Aviel in 2 days for PNW Hackathon 2023
This chrome extension was made for the purpose of allowing people to right click on a web page and add it to different folder to save for later.
It's similar to bookmarks but faster and easier to use. First off, you can open all the folder related tabs in one go, or select which ones you want to open up. Its faster 
on the aspect of ust a simple right click and button press can move it to a folder, instead of chooseing which folder in bookmarks to add items to.
